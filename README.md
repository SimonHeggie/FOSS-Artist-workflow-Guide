Some artists take the proprietary sucker extreme and blow their budget on a workflow headache with too many shortcuts and UI differences. Some artists go the opposite way and seem cult-like in their love of all things free and open source.

I simply want to advocate for what I believe is a rational option between these two extremes. I believe in having free opensource software as a financial and productivity back-up, and bolstering the lesser attempts at industry standard practice; with paid software and extensions.

Some things can even be better. If you, like I struggle to maintain concentration; your problem regardless of the quality of software - may be the complexity of your workflow.

MOST of the software is opensource and free. Regardless, some money will need to be spent to ensure some equal footing with industry standard products. 

The document for the following goals in the following order: Industry standard productivity, Cost efficiency, Data privacy, hardware performance optimisation, more freedom in software licensing. I make not claims that this is THE way to achieve all of that, but I can tell you I successfully rely on the workflow. I've been a pro since 2012, working in studios, freelancing and even as a high earning slot machine artist when I started introducing opensource software into my pipeline. 

This new workflow is a strategically shifting guide that reflects that experience.
